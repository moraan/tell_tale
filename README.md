## What Our App Currently Does
Currently, users of the app are capable of creating, signing into and logging out of their own personal accounts. Users will be taken to a page with texts and images from the children’s book “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” once they sign in to their account. The website only has one book so far. Users can read the book once they click the “Start Reading” button, which will then start recording the user’s voice. When trigger words are read, a sound corresponding to the word will be played. There is also a “Stop Reading” button which would enable the app to stop recording voice input.
