## What Our App Currently Does
Our app is an immersive storyteller offering three captivating children's stories: 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar,' 'Goodnight Moon,' and 'Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?' Upon signing in, users navigate a grid view to select their preferred tale. For the best experience, we recommend using the Chrome browser. Once chosen, users can personalize the story experience. A unique feature enables users to select and deselect specific words, triggering corresponding sounds during the reading journey, bringing the story to life. The voice recognition function tracks spoken words to initiate sound events, further enhancing the interactive experience.
